cl-openal is a series of (largely untested) semi-lispy bindings to the OpenAL library. AL, ALC, and
ALUT all have bindings written for them.  The bindings follow basically a translation of naming
schemes, and work mostly the same way. Enums are usually just :keywords with AL_/ALC_/ALUT_ removed,
camelCaps are rewritten in a lispier-style, isSuchAndSuch -> such-and-such-p; isSuch -> suchp, etc.
There are some convenient additions, though, such as being able to pass lists into functions instead
of having to allocate foreign objects (and receive lists from some functions that would require
pointers). Things should be pretty clear by just looking at packages.lisp, or the source files.
Actual documentation will come eventually. These are very new, so use them at your own risk.

cl-openal depends on CFFI to load. You'll also need to have openal and alut installed in your
system, and accessible to lisp.
